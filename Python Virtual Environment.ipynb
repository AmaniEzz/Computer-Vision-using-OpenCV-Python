    "# 1) Creating Python Virtual Environment in Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Virtual Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. So basically it is a tool that enables multiple side-by-side installations of Python, one for each project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we need a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a scenario where you are working on two web based python projects and one of them uses a OpenVC 2 and the other uses OpenCV 4 and so on. In such situations virtual environment can be really useful to maintain dependencies of both the projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## When and where to use a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "The real problem for Python is that it can’t differentiate between different versions in the “site-packages” directory. For example, both v2.0 and v4.0 would reside in the same directory with the same name. This is where virtual environments come into play. To solve this problem, we just need to create two separate virtual environments for both the projects.The great thing about this is that there are no limits to the number of environments you can have since they’re just directories containing a few scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does a virtual environment work?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a module named virtualenv which is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Installing virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "To install virtualenv Run this command:  `> pip install virtualenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) create a virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In which ever directory you are, Run this command to create a virtualenv there:    `> virtualenv myenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Specify Python interpreter of your choice\n",
    "\n",
    "- for example Python 3, it can be done using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`> virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 myenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a Python 2.7 virtual environment, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`> virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 myenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) activate a virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Now after creating virtual environment, you need to activate it. Remember to activate the relevant virtual environment every time you work on the project. Now if you are in the same directory then type:    \n",
    "\n",
    "`> myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "                                \n",
    "As long as your virtual environment is activated pip will install packages into that specific environment and you’ll be able to import and use packages in your Python application.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install opencv==4.4.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenCV 4.4.0 package will be placed in **myenv** folder and will be isolated from the complete system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5) How to deactivate it\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are done with the work, you can deactivate the virtual environment by the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`> deactivate`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you will be back to system’s default Python installation.\n",
